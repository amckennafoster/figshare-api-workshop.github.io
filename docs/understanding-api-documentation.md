# Understanding the API Documentation

## Where is the documentation?

The Figshare API is documented at https://docs.figshare.com. If you are an administrator at an institution, you have access to a stage version of the API as well.

## How to read the documentation

There are three panes on the documentation site
1. Left side: Table of Contents with links to the endpoints and documentation sections
2. Middle: Endpoint details including the endpoint syntax, a short description, error information, and some endpoints can be called directly in this pane
3. Right side: Input and Output examples. Depending on the endpoint you may see:
 a. If the endpoint accepts data you will see a "Body Sample" and a "Body Schema"
 b. If the endpoint provides data you will see a "Response Sample" and a "Response Schema"
