# Programmatically Creating or Managing Records

Creating private, unpublished records through the API is relatively simple and you can use <a href="https://docs.figshare.com/#private_article" target="_blank">one endpoint</a>. You can also use the API to upload many files or very large files and then publish the record. And you can manage existing records.

*Note: The ability to approve records for review is not available through the API. That must be done through the review interface.*

The resource page for <a href="https://amckennafoster.github.io/figshare-api-workshop.github.io/resources/create-upload-publish.html" target="_blank">creating, uploading, and publishing</a> overviews the steps to create various types of records.

## Working with existing metadata

If you have a set of harvested metadata records that you would like to add to your repository, there is <a href="https://amckennafoster.github.io/figshare-api-workshop.github.io/resources/batch-upload-from-source.html" target="_blank">a resource page</a> with some advice and a starter script. That example uses metadata harvested from the [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) database.

You will most likely need to do some data formatting. This can be done in a variety of ways, even in a spreadsheet! But using a script is probably easier and less error prone. There is <a href="https://amckennafoster.github.io/figshare-api-workshop.github.io/resources/formatting.html" target="_blank">a formatting resource page</a> with advice on common formatting needs.
