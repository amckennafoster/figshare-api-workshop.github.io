# Figshare API Workshop Schedule

This workshop assumes no prior experience working with APIs or coding. However, any experience level will gain from the workshop. It is organized around a personal project. The project can be as simple as writing a script to upload metadata or as complex as beginning a plan to build a custom user interface for your repository.
