## Technology Check

### Software

The examples in this workshop are mostly in Python. Examples using other languages are available from the [API documentation page](htttps://docs.figshare.com). There are two ways to use the example scripts:
1. Have Python downloaded to your machine (and Jupyter Notebook is useful for testing and adding notes).
2. Have a Google account and use Google Colab.

### Sandbox Instance
If you are at an institution that uses Figshare, it may be beneficial to use your institution's sandbox. If that is not available or you institution does not use Figshare, we will give you access to our Global University sandbox. You can also use a free Figshare account for many of the examples.
