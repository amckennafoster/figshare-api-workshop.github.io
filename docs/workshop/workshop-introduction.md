## Workshop Overview

Because participants may have different skill levels, we want you to go through this workshop with a specific use case (or two) that you'd like to work on.  Write down one or two ways you would like to use the Figshare API. Here are some starter ideas:
- Download metadata from my account or my repository for reporting or analysis purposes
- Upload harvested metadata in batch
- Download metadata and associated reuse metrics for reporting purposes
- Upload metadata and files through the API as part of an automated process
- Build the initial components to complete a custom web interface.

## Technology Check

### Software

The Figshare API can be used with any scripting language that can interact with APIs. The [documentation site](https://docs.figshare.com) offers sample code for several different languages. To use those examples you must use the Swagger client.

The examples in this workshop primarily use Postman and we will help participants access this platform. Our purpose is to help workshop participants understand how to extract information using the API no matter what software is used.

### Sandbox Instance
If you are at an institution that uses Figshare, it may be beneficial to use your institution's sandbox. If that is not available or your institution does not use Figshare, we will provide access to our Global University sandbox. You can also use a free Figshare account for many of the examples.

Please see the [sandbox instructions](./sandbox-instructions.html) for login information and guidance on creating an API token.

### Other Resources
There are general descriptions and resources [available here](../resources/resources.html). The examples in those pages use Python.
