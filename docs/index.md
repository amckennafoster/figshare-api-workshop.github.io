# Figshare API Resources

You can use the Figshare API to automate record management, gather statistics, or even build custom web apps for users or administrators. 

*Note: Interested in migrating records in batch? This is certainly possible through the API. However, if you are a reposiory manager at an institution, the <a href="https://help.figshare.com/article/administrative-batch-management" target="_blank">Batch Management Tool</a> may be an easier option for you.*

## More Advanced Resources - Custom Web Apps and User Interfaces

You can create custom interfaces to display information from your Figshare account or repository. Online tools, like ChatGPT, can help. This was demonstrated in the API workshop Figshare ran at the 2023 Open Repositories Conference. You can see the resources for this demonstration on the [workshop page](./workshop/workshop-custom-app.html) and [the workshop slides](../assets/Figshare-API-Workshop-Open-Repositories-2023.pdf).
