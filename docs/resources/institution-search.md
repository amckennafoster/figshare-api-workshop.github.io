# Search for records related to your institution

You can search for your institution's name and do a high level analysis of the records out there. As an example, we created a [Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15JGN6dx6OXfqQ2779TCmOhqQEOrLyt5u?usp=sharing). 

Anyone can run this script. One must only add search criteria and run all the cells in sequence. You can also save all the data as a Google sheet in your Google Drive.
