# Create an author report

The API can provide information for individual authors. As an example, we created a [Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tl25Lc_SGk1OKjnMA54HeRaVM3VYUpYP?usp=sharing). 

Anyone can run this script. One must only add an author name or an ORCID. The script produces a table with metadata for the author's outputs and produces a plotly map of views for all the records.
